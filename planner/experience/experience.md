# Experience - what real on-device testing actually showed

- FRILL-based Voice ID: same-speaker cosine similarity ranged ~0.60-0.75 across retries even
  after silence-trimming + per-frame normalization fixes - inconsistent enough that a real
  same-voice retry got wrongly rejected at a 0.75 threshold. Root cause: FRILL is a
  general-purpose embedding, not built for speaker verification. Led to the full ECAPA-TDNN
  swap (Phase 1).
- After the ECAPA-TDNN swap: user's sister said "open WhatsApp" and it executed - turned out
  general voice commands were only ever LOGGING a Voice ID score, never actually gating on it.
  Fixed by making commands wait for a passing check before running.
- After that fix: user's OWN voice started getting rejected - averaging 3 enrollment takes into
  one reference vector was likely too narrow for natural voice variation (tired, sick, accent).
  Fixed by switching to a growing multi-sample pool matched by nearest-neighbor, not average.
  ** Not yet re-tested against real accept/reject numbers after this fix. **
- Random-digit anti-replay challenge for the lock screen: kept saying "that didn't match" /
  "voice unrecognized" - partly the digit-collapsing STT bug (fixed), but user found the whole
  challenge-response flow too much friction given every app is already independently
  lock-gated anyway. Reverted to plain record-and-compare (no challenge step).
- Recents app-lock fix: after the first pass, going into Recents and closing it WITHOUT
  switching apps re-triggered the fingerprint prompt (a loop) - root cause was a purely
  time-based grace window, not real continuity tracking. Fixed by tracking which app is
  actively "owned" instead of just elapsed time. ** User confirmed this is "manageable" given
  fingerprint covers it, but has NOT confirmed the loop is fully gone. **
- Flash-before-lock-prompt: user directly observed seeing a locked app's content briefly before
  being kicked to the PIN/fingerprint screen (a real security concern, e.g. if the phone were
  stolen). An instant black overlay was added to shorten this, but it is NOT and cannot be fully
  eliminated on a non-rooted device - this is an accepted, disclosed limitation, not a fixed bug.
- Continuous listening used to go fully dormant (refuse to listen at all) whenever media was
  playing - user found this blocked normal use (couldn't ask Elene anything while music/video
  played). Changed to request real AudioFocus (pausing well-behaved media) instead of refusing
  to listen. ** Not yet tested on-device. **

- Real on-device test (2026-07-26/27), via adb screenshots + dumpsys, not assumed: Elene's
  floating bubble was confirmed visible over the actual Android lock screen after locking via the
  power button while an app was in the foreground (screenshot + `isKeyguardShowing=true` from
  `dumpsys window` both captured at once). Fixed (see errors/) and re-confirmed hidden across two
  separate lock/wake cycles after the fix. This is exactly the kind of thing the standing rule
  below exists to catch - it would never have shown up from a plain `gradlew compile` check, only
  from actually driving the real device through the exact sequence (lock via timeout/power button,
  not via switching apps).

- (2026-07-27) Messaging assistant / calendar / call awareness / voice memo feature: built and
  installed. Confirmed so far via adb (build, install, launch with no crash, all four new
  permissions - READ_CALENDAR/READ_PHONE_STATE/ANSWER_PHONE_CALLS/READ_CALL_LOG - silently
  granted, accessibility service still connected). **Not yet confirmed**: an actual message
  reply/compose-and-send round trip with a real contact, calendar meeting-awareness with a real
  event, the ringing-announcement with a real incoming call, whether `acceptRingingCall()`
  actually answers on this Samsung device (the one genuinely unknown piece per the plan), and
  voice-memo playback. None of this should be treated as done until each of those has a real,
  observed result - same standing rule as below. Backend deployed to Cloud Run (revision
  elene-backend-00022-nvv, 2026-07-27) and smoke-tested with a real HTTP request - responds
  correctly. The new verbs/context fields are now actually live and reachable from the device,
  not just written - but still unconfirmed end-to-end (a real "reply to my last message" etc.
  hasn't been tried against the deployed backend yet).

- (2026-07-27) Backend redeployed again (revision elene-backend-00023-qc4) after the WhatsApp/
  call/voice-memo follow-up fixes, specifically to document the new end_call verb. Smoke-tested,
  responding correctly. Standing instruction from the user: always redeploy the backend after a
  main.py change, don't wait to be asked each time.

- (2026-07-27) Retried the install after "device offline" - fixed with `adb reconnect offline`
  (no cable/settings change needed, just a stale adb session). Confirmed via real device query
  (not assumed): all four new permissions (READ_CALENDAR, READ_CALL_LOG, ANSWER_PHONE_CALLS,
  READ_PHONE_STATE) show `granted=true` under `dumpsys package`, the accessibility service shows
  connected under `enabled_accessibility_services`, and the app launches with no FATAL/
  AndroidRuntime in logcat. The call-screening role correctly shows *not* granted yet in
  `dumpsys role` - expected, since `ROLE_CALL_SCREENING` requires a real user tap through the
  Security screen's system role prompt, unlike the silently-grantable permissions. **Still not
  confirmed**: an actual live cellular call decline through the role, or any of the message/
  calendar/call-answer/voice-memo round trips listed as unconfirmed above - this entry only
  confirms the install is healthy, not that the features work end to end.

## Standing meta-note from the user (2026-07-26)
User explicitly flagged that we were "bouncing from one thing to another" - building fix after
fix without confirming each one actually works before moving to the next. This planner exists
to stop that: before starting something new, check in_progress/ and don't add to done/ until
there's a real confirmed test result logged here.
